### E-REQUISITION SYSTEM
E-Requisition System is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive UIs. The system aims to streamline the process of managing requisitions within an organization by providing:

User Authentication: Users can log in with different roles like 'Requestor', 'Manager', or 'Procurement' staff, which dictate their permissions within the application.
Requisition Submission: A form (RequisitionForm) allows users to submit new requisitions with details like item name, quantity, estimated price, total price, justification, and budget code.

Approval Mechanism: Managers can approve or reject pending requisitions through an ApprovalDashboard.
Procurement Management: Procurement staff have access to a ProcurementDashboard where they can view approved requisitions and process them further.

Role-Based Access: Navigation and page access are controlled based on user roles to ensure that only authorized personnel can perform specific actions.

Data Persistence: Although this is a frontend-focused project, we simulate backend functionality by managing requisition data in local memory and localStorage for persistence between sessions.

Responsive Design: The system uses CSS (or would in a full implementation) to provide a user-friendly interface across different devices.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
